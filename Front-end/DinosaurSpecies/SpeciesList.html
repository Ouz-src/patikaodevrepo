        What Are the Characteristics of the Most Known Dinosaur Species?
        <br> <br>
        Triceratops <br>

        The most striking feature of Triceratops is its broad skull. Triceratops had the widest skull of all land
        animals, covering about a third of its total length. It is a plant-eating species that also falls under the
        armored category. The term Triceratops means "head with three horns". These dinosaurs lived during the
        Cretaceous period, about 68 million years ago. Most paleontologists think this dinosaur was 10 meters long and
        about four meters high. <br>

        stegosaurus <br>

        Stegosaurus means "roofed lizard". Paleontologists named it that way because they first had the idea that
        dinosaurs' plates were laid flat on their backs, like shingles on the roof of a house. The current thinking is
        that the plates stood upright on the dinosaurs' backs. Stegosaurs are among the dinosaurs best known for the
        idea that the dinosaur had two brains, one on the head and the other near the beginning of the tail. Stegosaurs
        have four large spikes on their tail that act as a weapon against predators. <br>

        Spinosaurus <br>

        This species is believed to have lived more than 100 million years ago during the Cretaceous Period. Currently,
        scientists have found two species of Spinosaurus, based on where their fossils were discovered. These;
        Spinosaurus Aegyptiacus and Spinosaurus Moracanus. Most paleontologists suggest that Spinosaurus was the largest
        carnivorous dinosaur ever. However, it is unclear how large it was due to missing fossils. In 2005, researchers
        estimated that the dinosaur was about 59 feet long and weighed about 10 tons. <br>

        Tyrannosaurus Rex <br>

        Probably the best known dinosaur is the T-Rex. The dinosaur's North American heritage and early discovery have
        made it not only among the best-known dinosaurs, but also the most famous dinosaur depicted in many Hollywood
        movies and documentaries. The Tyrannosaurus family, the most popular species of which is T.Rex, was the last
        dinosaur to appear on earth about 80 million years ago. Carnivorous theropods lived on the planet for a short
        time, but they have had a significant impact on how we understand dinosaurs. Scientists believe that the
        dinosaur could have weighed up to six tons. It was also about 13 meters long and had a strong tail that made
        this bipedal dinosaur well-balanced. Adult adults who live to age 28 are believed to be able to run at speeds of
        up to 25 miles per hour. <br>

        Brachiosaurus <br>

        This dinosaur species is a star in many movies such as Jurassic Park. It is also one of the largest land animals
        to have ever lived. This dinosaur belongs to the Sarichians group. The reptile roamed the earth about 145
        million years ago, between the middle of the Cretaceous period and the end of the Jurassic period. Brachiosaurus
        is estimated to have been 26 feet (less than 21 meters) long. Its weight ranged from 30 to 50 tons. In addition,
        it had a long neck, consisting of 12 vertebrae, each 70 centimeters. Its fossils were first discovered in 1903
        in the United States by Elmer Riggs. <br>
